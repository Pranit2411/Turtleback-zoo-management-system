# Turtleback-zoo-management-system


**GOALS:**
The goal of this phase is to incorporate all the learning and plans to form a DATABASE SCHEMA, and then use the same schema to create an interface for users (employees of the zoo).
Decided to create a web-based application that is going to showcase the use of the schema, we also need to make sure that it provides support for all the below mentioned services that are considered to be functional requirements:
● Animal Shows.
● Concessions.
● Zoo Admissions.
Moreover, the above mentioned services needs to provide feasibility to the user with the ability to:
● Track activities.
● Manage assets.
● Generate reports.

The implementation of the project is done on the below mentioned notes.
● Design a user-friendly web-based application using HTML, CSS and PHP.
● PHP to ensure seamless communication between the front-end and the back-end.
● MySQL is used as a database management system to store all the needed records.
● PHP scripts were integrated with MySQL to ensure that data could be seamlessly retrieved, stored, and manipulated as needed.
The above-mentioned notes allowed us to develop a robust and scalable system that could handle large volumes of data while ensuring high levels of performance and reliability.

**TOOLS & SOFTWARES USED:** ● XAMPP:
○ To Host Apache Server and MySQL. ● Visual Studio Code:
○ Code-editor to handle HTML, CSS and PHP code.
